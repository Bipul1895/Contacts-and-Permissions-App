SQLite Terminal :
To start SQLite in Terminal window, navigate to directory in which your db exists.
E.g. If name of db is test.db :
SQLite3 test.db

.schema : To know structure of all tables present in the db
.table : To know the names of all tables present in the db
.headers on : show attribute name while displaying query result

Using wildcard : The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in
                 a column. E.g. WHERE LIKE "%king%";

Note : Put semicolon to end SQLite statements.

Three commands which do not have semicolon int the end:
1) Backup command : .backup test-backup1
2)Restore command : .restore test-backup1
3)Initial command : SQLite3 test.db

SQLite Java :

If you perform CREATE TABLE command to create a table that already exists in the db, runtime error
will occur. To get rid of this error we can do : CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS.
