We can use ActivityCompat.requestPermissions() and onRequestPermissionResult() method to display a
dialog to user asking for permission. However, if user ticks "Do not ask again" checkbox and clicks
"Deny" our method will no longer be able to open the AlertDialog. In that case we should redirect
the user to the settings portion of the app so that user can grant permission from there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But the question is how do we know if the user has ticked the checkbox?
This is done using shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale() method of ActivityCompat.
shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale() : Gets whether you should show UI with rationale before
                                         requesting a permission

Parameters :
activity	Activity: The target activity.
permission	String: A permission your app wants to request

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Storing the state of permission "READ_CONTACTS_GRANTED" as field of MainActivity class turned out
to be a bad idea. When user goes to settings screen, we have no way of knowing whether user granted
permission there or not. It is actually better to use checkSelfPermission() method to check for
permission.
